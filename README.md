# AutoML with PyCaret and Streamlit

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly web application for automated machine learning using PyCaret, built with Streamlit. The application allows users to upload datasets, perform exploratory data analysis, automatically train machine learning models, and download the trained models for future use.

## Features

- **Upload Dataset**: Easily upload your dataset in CSV format.
- **Data Profiling**: Generate an extensive exploratory data analysis report using `ydata_profiling`.
- **AutoML Modeling**: Automatically set up and compare different machine learning models using PyCaret, then select the best-performing model.
- **Download Model**: Download the trained model as a pickle file for future use.

**Make sure you are using a Python version supported by PyCaret (3.9, 3.10, or 3.11)**

## Run project
- streamlit run app.py
